# Know_your_team

## Description

- The reason for creating this project was to help me manage future teams. Instead of creating a new team list from scratch I can now use the integrated terminal to access the command prompts and simply answer the proceeding questions to fill out an employee list. This now solves the issue of structuring a an employee list and I can now use the time I save to complete other tasks. I have one minor bug when running commands id like to fix in the future.
